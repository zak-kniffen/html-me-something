    <p>     I have an amazing wife and 3 beautiful children at home.  They are a big part of the reason I am taking this class.  I would like to say that I'm hoping to provide for them since I may be losing my job in the next year due to a recent acquisition of my company TD Ameritrade, but to be honest I think it is more important to me to show my family that you should strive to do something that makes you feel productive.\n\n</p>
    <p class="paragraphs" id="myParagraph">     After having spent over a decade in the brokerage industry, I am tired of making money off of other people making money off of those who actually produce new things.  I know the old adage goes "Do something you love and you will never have to work another day in your life," but I think doing something productive might be more powerful.\n\n</p>
    <p class="paragraphs">     In the future I will become a developer.  I am on the path towards that goal.  I can't wait to be able to talk about the things I have made, and to have the ability to do freelance work as well because of my marketable skills.  That flexibility and the feeling of accomplishmnent are something I will be able to show to my kids as an inspiration for their future endeavors.  I know along the way I will also find a way to help support my family, but in the meantime I will be empowering myself through new growth and creation.</p>
